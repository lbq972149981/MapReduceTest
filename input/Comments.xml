  <row Id="12360" PostId="13219" Score="0" Text="@DenisdeBernardy Respectfully, your answers on Startups are absolutely top-notch, but I do think this is a useful question.  I can't tell you how many people I've talked to with the same faulty assumption in starting up a venture, but it's a *very large* number.  I know one person who spent almost $100K on product in a *very competitive* industry and left no money for advertising because they assumed people would find and buy the products simply because they put up a website. By contrast, I was part of a small startup and increased revenues nearly 10x by the &quot;elbow grease&quot; method." CreationDate="2017-08-23T23:11:48.433" UserId="11133" />

There's a world of difference between event going to try to sell (that doesn't work) and event going to listen to problems and offering solutions (that actually works, but not often in 2 months because it takes time to become a recognized expert on a topic). Also, your marketer is probably wasting their time if they're junior and you haven't told them what works. (Plus, an actual sales should be doing that work _after_ you've figured out what works.)"
